preview release 1

not really a whole lot you can do with it... wait for the docs and stuff

BRIEF SUMMARY

This program is an integrated web server, templating system, and data abstraction layer. It's extremely fast. More later

BUILDING

cd core

# build the necessary libs (this only needs to be done once or if you get errors about missing files)
make libs [M32=true]

# builds:
# debug (default) - will give a lot errors and reload all panels every page load
# release - compiles with optimization on
#
# options:
# M32=true - required if you're on a 32 bit system
# BYTECODE=true - will print the bytecode to the console as it's executed
# WARN=true - turn on compiler warnings

make [release|debug] [M32=true] [BYTECODE=true] [WARN=true] [UNITTESTS=true]

LICENSE

I chose the GNU AGPL v3.0 for the same reasons MongoDB did. you can read about it here:
http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Licensing

basically, it's GPL with a stricter copyleft.. I want your code!
